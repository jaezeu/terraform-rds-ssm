## SSM Port Forwarding

We would also be using the SSM Port Forwarding feature to be able to remotely access our database from our local machine. This is useful if you want to access a database in a DB subnet via SQL workbench locally.

### Pre-Requisites

- AWS CLI with permissions configured to use the SSM:StartSession API call
- A AWS system manager managed instance - EC2, ECS, EKS etc.
- Make sure that your database instance is remotely accessible from your instance, i.e., the associated security group or firewall isnâ€™t blocking remote connections.
- Session manager plugin installed for your local machine
- SQL workbench(Optional) if you want to test connections

### Verify & Test SSM permissions

This command will work only if you have installed and configured the AWS CLI, and if your Session Manager administrator has granted you the necessary IAM permissions to access the target managed node using Session Manager.

```console
aws ssm start-session --target instance-id
```

### Open a connection forwarding session to a remote port on MySQL server

Note: In this example, I'm using local port 1053, but you can choose a different local port if you prefer.

```console
aws ssm start-session --target <ssm-managed-instance-id> --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost --parameters '{"portNumber":["3306"],"localPortNumber":["1053"],"host":["database-endpoint"]}'
```
### Verify that connection forwarding is working

I'm opening a second terminal session to establish my connection to the RDS database. As soon as I do that, a "Connection accepted for Session" message appears in my first terminal.
You can also try this with SQL workbench by connecting to: 127.0.0.1:1053
